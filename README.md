# AvroPinions

Opinionated stuff around AVRO in Ruby. Goals:

* Support some generic schema registry. You plug it in, conform to my API spec.
* Support [Single-Object Encoding](http://avro.apache.org/docs/1.8.2/spec.html#single_object_encoding) out of the box
    * Writing for now. Maybe reading later.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'avro_pinions'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install avro_pinions

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
